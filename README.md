# Spark-Foundation---Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis
A hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
The historical stock prices dataset was obtained from https://finance.yahoo.com/, while the news headlines data was obtained from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6. 
Using GOOG stock price data, I utilised the Auto-ARIMA model to forecast stock market values.
To create predictions in the sentiment analysis model, I used a variety of machine learning techniques, including Random Forest Regressor, LightGBM, Adaboost, and Xgboost.
